Terraform modules is a group of configuration files that provide common config functionality
 1. It enforce best practice.
 2. reduce amount of code
 3. reduce time to develop scripts
 
 There are many modules present open source (e.g. aws_vpc, ec2, azure compute, az network module) ---> Just source them with module block and configure the values
 
 
 
* Fine line between using Terraform and Ansible
Take example of postgress
Terraform providers - use for create postgress DB
modules - to create users
provisioners - one time scripts/ data manipulation at time of setup DB

Ansible - 
  Taking backup of DB, truncate daily tables (repeatable tasks)
