Local value assign a name to an expression, so you can use it multiple times within a module without repeating it.
Don't use locals much

use locals block, can have multiple blocks, can assign statis/dynamic values
locals {
  service_name = "forum"
  owner = "community Team"
}
#Accessing local within local
locals {
  common_tags ={
    Service = local.service_name
	Owner = local.owner
  }
}
*once local value is declared you can referenced it as local.<Name>
